    <p>Question 14 does not have the else part of the conditional. 
      Does that mean we have to write it ourselves or was it left out intentionally?
    </p>
    <p>I am having trouble understanding question 15. 
      It seems that it's saying that if the amount of pets that I have equals the amount of pets allowed, I should log that I've got too many pets. 
      But that does not seem logical to me. What am I missing?</p>
